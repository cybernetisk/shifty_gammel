How to start up with ruby on rails on ubuntu:

1. Ruby on rails and shifty has some dependencies to other libraries
   that will haunt you later if you don't have them installed, so make
   sure you have libsqlite3-dev, libpq-dev and nodejs installed from
   your repository

   (should be something like apt-get install libsqlite3-dev libpq-dev nodejs)

2. We need rvm to manage ruby version, so follow instructions on:
	
	https://rvm.io/rvm/install/
	
   If you don't have curl installed, you can get it from the repository.

3. Make sure rails and bundler is installed:
	gem install rails
	gem install bundler

4. In the shifty folder, run `bundle install`

5. You should be finished now, try to run `rails s` to start the webserver.
